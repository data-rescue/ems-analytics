The Data Science for Social Good recommends that a naming convention is used when creating jupyter notebooks. I would also like to follow the recommendation as I believe will make it easier to search for notebooks in this folder.

The naming convention is:
1. date YYYYMMDD (for ordering)
2. the creators initial's (e.g., ans)
3. a short '-' delimited description

Notebook Naming Sample:
